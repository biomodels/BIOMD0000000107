The model reproduces the time profile of active MPF at cyclin concentration of
100nM as depicted in Fig 4A of the paper. Please note that active MPF and
cyclin concentrations in the paper are given relative to total cdc2
concentration (100nM). Active MPF (dimer_p) is the cyclin-cdc2 complex that is
phosphorylated at Thr161. The model was successfully tested on MathSBML and
Jarnac.
